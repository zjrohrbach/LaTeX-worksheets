  \begin{enumerate}
    \item 
      Put your name two places: On your Scantron and on the first page of the Exam Packet.
    \item 
      On your Scantron, bubble in your 3-digit ZipGrade ID from your notebook.
    \item 
      Remember, you can use your notebook, but you cannot use review packets or any other materials.
    \item 
      You may write on the exam.  There is space provided to show your work, but only your scantron will be graded.
    \item 
      {\bf
        PHONES AND EARBUDS NEED TO BE PUT AWAY DURING THE EXAM.
      }
    \item 
      When you are finished, turn your scantron and your exam {\bf face down on your desk} and sit silently until Mr. Rohrbach indicates that everyone has turned in their exam.
