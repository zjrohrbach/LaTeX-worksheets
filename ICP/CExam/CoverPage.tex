      Tear off this scantron and the Periodic Table on the back page.
    \item 
      Put your name two places: On your Scantron and on the first page of the Exam Packet.
    \item 
      On your Scantron, bubble in your 3-digit ZipGrade ID from your notebook.

      Remember, you can use your notebook, but you cannot use review packets or any other materials.

      You may write on your Periodic Table and on the exam.  There is space provided to show your work, but only your scantron will be graded.
    \item 
      {\bf
        PHONES AND EARBUDS NEED TO BE PUT AWAY DURING THE EXAM.
      }
