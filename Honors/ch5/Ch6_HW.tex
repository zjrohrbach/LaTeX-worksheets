\myquestion (OpenStax P4)
(a) What is the period of rotation of Earth (\emph{i.e} one day) in seconds? (b) What is the angular velocity of Earth? (c) Given that Earth has a radius of \SI{6.4e6}{m} at its equator, what is the linear velocity at Earth's surface?
\answer{(a) \SI{86400}{sec}; (b) \SI{7.3e-5}{rad/s}; (c) 470 m/s}

\myquestion (OpenStax P7)
A truck with 0.420-m-radius tires travels at 32.0 m/s. What is the angular velocity of the rotating tires in radians per second? What is this in rev/min?
\answer{76.2 rad/s; 728 rpm}

\myquestion (Giancolli P1)
A child sitting 1.20 m from the center of a merry-go-round moves with a speed of 1.10 m/s.  (a) Calculate the centripetal acceleration of the child.   (b) Calculate the net horizontal force exerted on the child (mass = 22.5 kg).
\answer{(a) 1.01 m/s$^2$; (b) 22.7 N}

\myquestion (OpenStax P10)
A fairground ride spins its occupants inside a flying saucer-shaped container. If the horizontal circular path the riders follow has an 8.00 m radius, at how many revolutions per minute will the riders be subjected to a centripetal acceleration whose magnitude is 1.50 times that due to gravity?
\answer{1.36 rad/s = 12.9 rpm}

\myquestion (OpenStax P19) 
A rotating space station is said to create ``artificial gravity''â€”a loosely-defined term used for an acceleration that would be crudely similar to gravity. The outer wall of the rotating space station would become a floor for the astronauts, and centripetal acceleration supplied by the floor would allow astronauts to exercise and maintain muscle and bone strength more naturally than in non-rotating space environments. If the space station is 200~m in diameter, what angular velocity would produce an ``artificial gravity'' of \SI{9.8}{m/s^2} at the rim?
\answer{0.313 rad/s}

(b) What centripetal force does she need to stay on an amusement park merry-go-round that rotates at 3.00 rev/min if she is 8.00 m from its center? (c) Compare each force with her weight.

\myquestion (Giancolli P7)
A car travels at constant speed down the bottom of a valley and up the other side of a road whose bottom has a radius of curvature of 0.9 m.  The driver feels a normal force equal to twice their weight. What is the car's speed?
\answer{33.6 m/s}

\myquestion (Giancolli P19 part a \& c)
A 975-kg sports car (including driver) crosses the rounded top of a hill (radius = 88.0 m) at 18.0 m/s.
Determine: (a) The normal force exerted by the road on the car. (b) The car speed at which the normal force equals zero.
\answer{(a) 5965 N; (b) 29.4 m/s}


\myquestion (Giancolli P73)
At what minimum speed must a roller coaster be traveling so that passengers upside down at the top of the circle (Figure~\ref{G5-48}) do not fall out? Assume a radius of curvature of 8.6 m.
\answer{9.1 m/s}

    \caption{(OpenStax Fig  6.35) Teardrop-shaped loops are used in the latest roller coasters so that the radius of curvature gradually decreases to a minimum at the top. This means that the centripetal acceleration builds from zero to a maximum at the top and gradually decreases again. A circular loop would cause a jolting change in acceleration at entry, a disadvantage discovered long ago in railroad curve design. With a small radius of curvature at the top, the centripetal acceleration can more easily be kept greater than g so that the passengers do not lose contact with their seats nor do they need seat belts to keep them in place.}

\myquestion \textbf{Bonus!} (OpenStax P31) 
Modern roller coasters have vertical loops like the one shown in Figure~\ref{6.35}. The radius of curvature is smaller at the top than on the sides so that the downward centripetal acceleration at the top will be greater than the acceleration due to gravity, keeping the passengers pressed firmly into their seats. What is the speed of the roller coaster at the top of the loop if the radius of curvature there is 15.0 m and the downward acceleration of the car is $1.50 g$?

\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
  \item (OpenStax CQ7) A number of amusement parks have rides that make vertical loops like the one shown in Figure~\ref{6.35}. For safety, the cars are attached to the rails in such a way that they cannot fall off. If the car goes over the top at just the right speed, gravity alone will supply the centripetal force. What other force acts and what is its direction if: (a) The car goes over the top at faster than this speed? (b) The car goes over the top at slower than this speed?

  \item (Based on OpenStax CQ15 and Giancolli MC6) In one amusement park ride--called the ``Roto-Ride''-- riders enter a large vertical barrel and stand against the wall on its horizontal floor.

A ``near-Earth'' orbit is at a height above the surface of the Earth that is very small compared to the radius of the Earth.
