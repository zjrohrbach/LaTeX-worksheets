  \question
    A projectile is fired with an initial speed of 36.6 m/s at an angle of 42.2 degrees above horizontal on a long flat firing range.  What is the total horizontal distance (that is, range) covered by the projectile?  Compare your answer with question 2(c) on the ``Projectile Motion Practice Problems.''
