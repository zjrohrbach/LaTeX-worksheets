\question
  Sandy Squirrel travels 18 m east and 41 m north to get to her secret stash of Emerald Nuts.  Chester Chipmunk decides to take a short cut and travel in a straight line to the location of the (not so) secret stash.  How far did he travel and at what angle?

\question

  Consider the following vectors:
  %
  \begin{align*}
    \vec{A} &= \SI{30}{m} \text{ @ 60$^\circ$ N of E} \\
    \vec{B} &= \SI{10}{m} \text{, \sc East}
  \end{align*}
  %
  Calculate $\vec{R}=\vec{A}+\vec{B}$.
