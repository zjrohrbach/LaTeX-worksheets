  \question
    A marble rolls off a 0.8-meter tall table at a horizontal speed of 3 m/s.

  \begin{parts}
    \part 
      How far from the base of the table will the marble land?
    \part
      What is the marble's velocity (magnitude and direction) the moment before it hits the ground?
  \end{parts}

  \question
    A projectile is fired with an initial speed of 36.6 m/s at an angle of 42.2 degrees above horizontal on a long flat firing range.
  
  \begin{parts}
    \part
      What is the maximum height reached by the projectile?
    \part 
      How much time is the projectile in the air?
    \part 
      What is the total horizontal distance (that is, range) covered by the projectile?
