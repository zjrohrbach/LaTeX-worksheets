\myquestion (OpenStax P28) 
(a) A daredevil is attempting to jump his motorcycle over a line of buses parked end to end by driving up a $32^\circ$  ramp at a speed of 40.0~m/s. How many buses can he clear if the top of the takeoff ramp is at the same height as the bus tops and the buses are 20.0~m long? (b) Discuss what your answer implies about the margin of error in this act—that is, consider how much greater the range is than the horizontal distance he must travel to miss the end of the last bus. (Neglect air resistance.)

\myquestion (OpenStax P29)
An archer shoots an arrow at a 75.0~m distant target; the bull's-eye of the target is at same height as the release height of the arrow. (a) At what angle must the arrow be released to hit the bull's-eye if its initial speed is 35.0~m/s? In this part of the problem, explicitly show how you follow the steps involved in solving projectile motion problems.

\myquestion (OpenStax P33)
The cannon on a battleship can fire a shell a maximum distance of 32.0~km. (a) Calculate the initial velocity of the shell. (b) What maximum height does it reach? (At its highest, the shell is above 60\% of the atmosphere—but air resistance is not really negligible as assumed to make this problem easier.) \answer{(a) 560 m/s; (b) 8000 m} 

\myquestion (OpenStax P34)
An arrow is shot from a height of 1.5 m toward a cliff of height $H$. It is shot with a velocity of 30~m/s at an angle of $60^\circ$ above the horizontal. It lands on the top edge of the cliff 4.0~s later. (a) What is the height of the cliff? (b) What is the maximum height reached by the arrow along its trajectory?

\myquestion (OpenStax P41)
An owl is carrying a mouse to the chicks in its nest. Its position at that time is 4.00 m west and 12.0 m above the center of the 30.0 cm diameter nest. The owl is flying east at 3.50 m/s at an angle 30.0º below the horizontal when it accidentally drops the mouse. Is the owl lucky enough to have the mouse hit the nest? To answer this question, calculate the horizontal position of the mouse when it has fallen 12.0 m. \answer{4.23 m forward of drop location; misses the nest}

% \myquestion (OpenStax P43)
% Can a goalkeeper at her/ his goal kick a soccer ball into the opponent's goal without the ball touching the ground? The distance will be about 95 m. A goalkeeper can give the ball a speed of 30 m/s. \answer{No. Max range $\approx 92$ m}

\myquestion (OpenStax P45) 
In 2007, Michael Carter (U.S.) set a world record in the shot put with a throw of 24.77~m. What was the initial speed of the shot if he released it at a height of 2.10~m and threw it at an angle of $38.0^\circ$ above the horizontal? (Although the maximum distance for a projectile on level ground is achieved at $45^\circ$  when air resistance is neglected, the actual angle to achieve maximum range is smaller; thus, "38º"  will give a longer range than $45^\circ$ in the shot put.) \answer{15.0 m/s}

\myquestion \textbf{Bonus!} (OpenStax P35)
In the standing broad jump, one squats and then pushes off with the legs to see how far one can jump. Suppose the extension of the legs from the crouch position is 0.600 m and the acceleration achieved from this position is 1.25 times the acceleration due to gravity, g. How far can they jump? State your assumptions. (Increased range can be achieved by swinging the arms in the direction of the jump.) \answer{1.50 m}

\myquestion \textbf{Bonus!} (OpenStax P47)
A football player punts the ball at a $45.0^\circ$ angle. Without an effect from the wind, the ball would travel 60.0~m horizontally. (a) What is the initial speed of the ball? (b) When the ball is near its maximum height it experiences a brief gust of wind that reduces its horizontal velocity by 1.50 m/s. What distance does the ball travel horizontally?

  \subsection*{Conceptual Questions}
  }

\begin{enumerate}[resume*]
  \item (Original question) When (if ever) is the velocity of a projectile fired at an angle zero?
  \item (OpenStax CQ15) For a fixed initial speed, the range of a projectile is determined by the angle at which it is fired. For all but the maximum, there are two angles that give the same range. Considering factors that F affect the ability of an archer to hit a target, such as wind, explain why the smaller angle (closer to the horizontal) is preferable. When would it be necessary for the archer to use the larger angle? Why does the punter in a football game use the higher trajectory?
  \item (Giancolli CQ15) A projectile is launched at an upward angle of $30^\circ$ to the horizontal with a speed of 30~m/s.  HOw does the horizontal component of its velocity 1.0~s after launch compare with ts horizontal component of velocity 2.0~s after launch, ignoring air resistance?  Explain.
