  \question 
    A baseball pitcher throws a baseball with a speed of 43~m/s.  Estimate the acceleration of the ball during the throwing motion.  In throwing the baseball, the pitcher accelerates it through a displacement of about 3.5~m.

  \question
    A world-class sprinter can reach a top speed of 11.5~m/s in the first 18.0~m of a race.  What is the average acceleration of this sprinter?  How long does it take her to reach that speed?

    \begin{solution}
      3.67 m/s$^2$; 3.13~s
    \end{solution}

  \question
    A car slows down uniformly from a speed of 28.0~m/s to rest in 8.00~s.  How far did it travel in that time?

    \begin{solution}
      $a=-3.5$~m/s$^2$; 112~m
    \end{solution}

  \question
    You are driving in a car going 26~m/s.  All of a sudden, you see an obstacle in the road.  Calculate the stopping distance of your car.  Assume that your human reaction time is 0.40~seconds and the deceleration applied by the brakes is 3.0~m/s$^2$.

    \begin{solution}
      $0.4 \cdot 26 = 10.4$; $26^2/(2\cdot 3.0) = 112.7$; total distance = 123.1~m
    \end{solution}
