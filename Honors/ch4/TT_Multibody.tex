\newcommand{\one}{

  \paragraph{Task \#1}
  Consider a 1400-kg car that experiences 900 N of friction and 1300 N of air drag. How much force must the car's engine exert in order to maintain a constant speed of 45 m/s?

  \begin{solution}
    2200 N
  \end{solution}

}

\newcommand{\two}{
  \paragraph{Task \#2}
  Two boxes have masses $m_1=20$ kg and $m_2=10$ kg and are sitting on a frictionless surface connected by a massless cord. If they are pulled with an applied force of $F_A=50$ N, calculate (a) their acceleration and (b) the tension in the cord connecting them.


  \tikzstyle{box}=[rounded corners,draw,minimum height=1cm]

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[box,minimum width=1.5cm] (one) at (0,0) {$m_1$};
    \node[box,minimum width=1.5cm] (two) at (3,0) {$m_2$};
    \draw (one.east) -- (two.west);
    \draw[->,ultra thick] (two.east) ++(0,0.2) -- +(1,0) node[anchor=south west] {$\vec{F}_A$};
    \fill[pattern=north east lines] (-1,-0.5) rectangle ++(6,-0.25);
  \end{tikzpicture}

  \begin{solution}
    1.67 m/s$^2$; 16.7 N
  \end{solution}
}

\newcommand{\three}{
  \paragraph{Task \#3} 
  Two masses $m_1=4$ kg and $m_2=2$ kg are attached by a string that hangs over a frictionless pulley. What is (a) the tension on the string and (b) the acceleration of the masses? (This is known as an \emph{Atwood Machine})

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[box] (one) at (-.75,0) {$m_1$};
    \node[box] (two) at (.75,-0.5) {$m_2$};
    \draw[very thick] (one.north) -- (-.75,3) 
      arc (180:0:.75) -- (two.north);
    \draw[very thick] (0,3) circle[radius=.75];
  \end{tikzpicture}

  \begin{solution}
    26.14 N; 3.27 m/s$^2$

    Extension: How much downward force would need to be applied on $m_2$ in order to keep the system from moving? (19.6 N)
  \end{solution}
}

\newcommand{\four}{
  \paragraph{Task \#4} 
  We now have what is called a \emph{Modified Atwood Machine} with $m_1=4$ kg and $m_2=3$ kg. What is (a) the tension on the string and (b) the acceleration of the masses? Again, the surface is frictionless.

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node[box,minimum width=1.5cm] (one) at (0,0) {$m_1$};
    \node[box] (two) at (3.75,-3) {$m_2$};
    \draw[very thick] (one.east) -- (3.5,0) arc (90:0:0.25) -- (two);
    \fill[pattern=north east lines] (-3,-0.5) rectangle
      ++(6,-0.25);
    \draw (-3,-0.5) -- 
      ++(6,0) coordinate (edge) -- 
      ++(0,-1);
    \draw (edge) -- (3.5,-0.25) circle (0.25);
