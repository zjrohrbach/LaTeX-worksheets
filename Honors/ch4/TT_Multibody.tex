\question
Consider a 1400-kg car that experiences 900 N of friction and 1300 N of air drag. How much force must the car's engine exert in order to maintain a constant speed of 45 m/s?

\begin{solution}
  2200 N

\question
Two masses $m_1=4$ kg and $m_2=2$ kg are attached by a string that hangs over a frictionless pulley. What is (a) the tension on the string and (b) the acceleration of the masses? (This is known as an \emph{Atwood Machine})

  \node[box] (one) at (-.75,0) {$m_1$};
  \node[box] (two) at (.75,-0.5) {$m_2$};
  \draw[very thick] (one.north) -- (-.75,3) 
    arc (180:0:.75) -- (two.north);
  \draw[very thick] (0,3) circle[radius=.75];
\end{tikzpicture}

\begin{solution}
  26.14 N; 3.27 m/s$^2$

  Extension: How much downward force would need to be applied on $m_2$ in order to keep the system from moving? (19.6 N)

\question
We now have what is called a \emph{Modified Atwood Machine} with $m_1=4$ kg and $m_2=3$ kg. What is (a) the tension on the string and (b) the acceleration of the masses? Again, the surface is frictionless.
