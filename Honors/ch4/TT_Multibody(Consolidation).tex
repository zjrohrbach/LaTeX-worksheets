Two masses are suspended at rest.  Assume that $m_1=5.2$~kg and $m_2 = 1.7$~kg.

\begin{parts}
  \part Calculate the tension on each rope. \vs
  \part Now you've detached rope A and are accelerating the system upward at a rate of \SI{0.5}{m/s^2}, what would be the tensions on both ropes? \vs

Two boxes have masses $m_1=20$ kg and $m_2=10$ kg and are sitting on a frictionless surface connected by a massless cord. If they are pulled with an applied force of $F=50$ N, calculate (a) their acceleration and (b) the tension in the cord connecting them.
