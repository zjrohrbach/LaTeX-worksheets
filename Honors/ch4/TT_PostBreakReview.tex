\question You ($m=46$ kg) are standing on a an elevator on the top floor of a building.  The elevator begins to go down towards the ground floor and does so by accelerating downward at 2.7 m/s$^2$.  What is the normal force acting on you?

\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]
  326.6 N 
\end{solution}

\question Two crates of mass 65~kg and 125~kg are in contact and at rest on a horizontal frictionless surface.  A 650-N force is exerted on 65-kg crate.  Calculate (a) the acceleration of the system and (b) the force that each crate exerts on the other.

\begin{solution}[\stretch{1}]
  (a) \SI{3.42}{m/s^2} (b) \SI{427.5}{N} (c) \SI{3.42}{m/s^2} and \SI{22.3}{N} 
\end{solution}
