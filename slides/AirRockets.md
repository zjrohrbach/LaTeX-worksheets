# Goal:

## Hit your target it three launches.

### Launch #1
Set your cone where you expect your projectile to land

### Launch #2
Keep the same pressure, but change the angle to try to hit the target

### Launch #3
Make any other changes to pressure and angle that are needed


----

# How to use the launcher

- changing angle
  - loosen and tighten the screws
  - make sure indicator does not fall out of alignment
- pressurizing and releasing
  - use the gauge on launchpad, not the one on the pump
  - make sure to "clear out" pressure each time

----

# Ground rules

- Do not be rough with lab equipment.
- Do not launch the rocket with an angle higher than $80^\circ$
- Do not pressurize more than 100 PSI
- Do not try to catch the rockets
- Do not be stupid

# What to do when you get outside

1. One person needs to put your cone at the target
2. Set the launchpad to "pressurize" and pump to 70 PSI.
3. Wait for Mr. Rohrbach to check your setup
4. Launch.  Watch where it lands
5. ***Everyone in the group must fill out their data table and answer the questions about Launch #1 before moving on to Launch #2***
