\section*{Course Description}

Physics is the study of how the universe works on the most fundamental level.  In this 
class, you will use your powers of observation and logical as well as mathematical 
reasoning to describe, explain, and predict the behavior of objects.

\paragraph{Course Goals} 
As a result of taking Physics I, you will:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Know and understand the process that is used to make the scientific discoveries that 
				are reported in the media or in the workplace
	\item Understand the scientific principles that underlie motion, forces, waves, and electricity.
	\item Apply your mathematical skills to solving real-world problems
	\item Develop problem solving and scientific literacy skills
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Required Materials}

You are expected to bring the following materials with you to class every day.  

\begin{center}

\begin{tikzpicture}
	
	
	\node [font=\large] at (0, .5) {Notebook};
	\node [font=\small\it] at (0, 0)  {(will be provided to you)};
	\node at (0,1.7) {\includegraphics[width=2.4cm]{notebook}};


	\node [font=\large] at (3, .5) {Reading};
	\node [font=\large] at (3, 0)  {Book};
	\node at (3,1.7) {\includegraphics[width=2.4cm]{book}};

\end{center}




\section*{Methods of Evaluation}

Your pre-exam grade will be based on the methods of 
evaluation shown below. The weighting of each of these 
categories is subject to change. Your overall class 
grade will consist of the pre-exam grade (85\%) and the
final exam grade (15\%).

\begin{center}
	\begin{tikzpicture}
		\pie[text=inside, radius=2.2]{
			30/Labs,
			20/Classwork,
			40/Tests,
			10/Quizzes
		}
	\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Tests may be corrected for half credit back on missed 
questions.  Test corrections are due by midterm.  In other 
words, test corrections for units completed before the 
midterm will not be accepted after the midterm.  Directions 
on how to do corrections will be given later.



\section*{Other Class Policies}

\paragraph{Late Work}
	Deadlines for assignments will be announced in class and posted on Schoology.  Late work is subject to a 50\% penalty.  Late work for a particular unit will not be accepted after the test is given for that unit.

\paragraph{Absences and Makeup Work}
	If you are absent, it is your responsibility to check Schoology for your required makeup work and contact Mr. Rohrbach with any questions.  Required makeup work is due in a timely manner.  	Mr. Rohrbach will often also post additional video explanations and recordings on Schoology for students who are absent. You should plan to watch these recordings and take notes over them before you return to school.

	There are some activities that we do in class which will not need to be made up.  Students with \emph{excused} absences will be exempted from these assignments in the grade book.  Students with \emph{unexcused} or \emph{unverified} absences will receive a zero, which cannot be made up.  This is in line with the policy in the AHS Student Handbook.

\paragraph{Contacting Mr. Rohrbach}
	Parents and students should feel free to contact Mr Rohrbach at any time via email (\texttt{ZJRohrbach@avon-schools.org}), phone (317-544-5000 x5131), \mbox{ParentSquare}, or Schoology.
