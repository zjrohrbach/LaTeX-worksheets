\section*{Course Description}

Physics is the study of how the universe works on the most fundamental level.  In this 
class, you will use your powers of observation and logical as well as mathematical 
reasoning to describe, explain, and predict the behavior of objects.

\paragraph{Course Goals} 
As a result of taking Physics I, you will:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Know and understand the process that is used to make the scientific discoveries that 
				are reported in the media or in the workplace
	\item Understand the scientific principles that underlie motion, forces, waves, and electricity.
	\item Apply your mathematical skills to solving real-world problems
	\item Develop problem solving and scientific literacy skills
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Required Materials}

You are expected to bring the following materials with you to class every day.

\begin{minipage}[b]{13.5cm}
	Additionally, please purchase and bring one package of three or four clear tape dispensors into the classroom for communal use by Friday, August 8.  We will be using these to tape important information into your notebooks as the year progresses.

\section*{Methods of Evaluation}

\begin{minipage}{4.4in}
Your pre-exam grade will be based on the methods of 
evaluation shown to the right. The weighting of each of these categories is subject to change. Your overall class grade will consist of the pre-exam grade (85\%) and the final exam grade (15\%).

\indent

Tests may be corrected for half credit back on missed 
questions.  Test corrections are due by midterm.  In other words, test corrections for units completed before the midterm will not be accepted after the midterm.  Directions on how to do corrections will be given later.

							\textit{We will have 10 minutes of sustained silent reading (SSR) at the beginning of the period.  Why do we do silent reading in a science class?  Research shows that people who read do better in school and have lower levels of stress.  It also is an opportunity to take a breath and set the tone for the class period.}

Failure to comply will result in the progressive discipline outlined in the AHS Student Handbook on p. 25.  Furthermore, use of phones, earbuds, or headphones for any reason during a test or quiz will result in a zero--even if the test has been turned in.}

\section*{Other Class Policies}

\paragraph{Late Work}
	Deadlines for assignments will be announced in class and posted on Schoology.  Late work is subject to a 50\% penalty.  Late work for a particular unit will not be accepted after the test is given for that unit.

\paragraph{Absences and Makeup Work}
	If you are absent, it is your responsibility to check Schoology for your required makeup work and contact Mr. Rohrbach with any questions.  Required makeup work is due in a timely manner.  	Mr. Rohrbach will often also post additional video explanations and recordings on Schoology for students who are absent. You should plan to watch these recordings and take notes over them before you return to school.

	There are some ``nonessential assignments'' that we do in class which will not need to be made up.  Students with \emph{excused} absences will be exempted from these assignments in the grade book.  Students with \emph{unexcused} or \emph{unverified} absences will receive a zero, which cannot be made up.  This is in line with the policy in the AHS Student Handbook on p. 14.
