\question
  A penguin by the name of Pickles ($m=23$ kg) is standing on a scale in an elevator on the top floor of a building.  The elevator begins to go down towards the ground floor and does so by accelerating downward at 2.7 m/s$^2$.  What is the normal force?
  \vs

\question
  A new sports car ($m=980$ kg) is capable of applying a force of 5500 N with its engine.  If the force of friction on the car is 500 N, what is the car's acceleration (assume no air resistance)? 
  \vs

\question
  You are pushing a large tub of chocolate, which has a mass of 455 kg, with an acceleration of 0.4 m/s$^2$.  The force of friction is 88 N.  What is the force with which you are pushing the tub?
  \vs

\question
  A fish ($m=9.1$ kg) is pulled straight up out of the water by a fisherman.  What is the acceleration of the fish if the force applied by the fisherman is 120 N?
  \vs

\noindent {\footnotesize Answers: (1) 163.3 N; (2) 5.10 m/s$^2$; (3) 270 N; (4) 3.39 m/s$^2$}
