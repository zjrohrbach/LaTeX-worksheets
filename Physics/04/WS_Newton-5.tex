    \question
      Neal is stealing a refrigerator (173 kg) from the bank.  If the force of friction on the refrigerator is 254~N, what force must he apply to have an acceleration of 1.27 m/s$^2$?
      \vs


    \question
      A skydiver (65 kg) deploys her parachute.  How much force does the parachute exert on the skydiver if her acceleration downwards is only 1.2 m/s$^2$?
      \vs

    \question
      A giant Snorlax is in your way and your PokeFlute is broken.  You need to pull it with a rope.  If you apply a force of 520 N and there is 510 N of friction, what is the acceleration of the Snorlax?   (According to the PokeDex, the average Snorlax's mass is about 459 kg.)
