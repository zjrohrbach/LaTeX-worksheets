\paragraph{Ex \#1} 

A horse named Epona pulls a 400-kg carriage with a force of 890 N.  If there is 115 N of friction, what is the acceleration?  Ignore air resistance.

\paragraph{Ex \#2} 

A bucket is being lifted out of a well.  It has a mass of 3.2~kg.  What force is needed to make the bucket accelerate at a rate of 1.35~m/s$^2$?

\pagebreak

\paragraph{Ex \#3} 

The engine of a 1300-kg car applies a force of 1235~N.  If there is 239~N of friction and 623~N of air drag, what is the acceleration of the car?
