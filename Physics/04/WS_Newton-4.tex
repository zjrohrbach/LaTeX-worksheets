    \question
      You and a friend are able to use a rope to pull a giant cement statue across the ground with an acceleration of 0.07 m/s$^2$.  If you apply a force of 500 N, your friend applies a force of 480 N, and the force of friction on the block is 300 N, what is the mass of the statue?

    \question
      Bobby is lifting buckets of water straight up out of a well using a rope.  If he applies a force of 50 N to a bucket with a mass of 3.2 kg, what is the acceleration of the bucket?
