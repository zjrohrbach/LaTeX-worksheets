  \question
    A car is initially travelling at 21 m/s.  If it travels 615 m in 9.2 s, what is its acceleration?
    \vs[2]

  \question
    A cyclist is going up a hill and slows down at a rate of $-5.8$ m/s$^2$ over 10 m.  At the end the cyclist is traveling at 2.3 m/s.  What was the speed of the bicycle before it got to the hill?
    \vs[2]

  \question
    A train starting from rest accelerates for 58 s at a rate of $0.42$ m/s$^2$.
