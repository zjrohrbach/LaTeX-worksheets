\paragraph{Ex \#1} 

You are driving in a car traveling at 18 m/s.  You accelerate at a constant rate of 1.3 m/s$^2$ until you get up to a speed of 24 m/s.  What distance do you cover when you do this?

\pagebreak

\paragraph{Ex \#2} 

A train is travelling at 73 m/s.  The engineer applies the brakes, which cause the train to decelerate at a rate of 1.8~m/s$^2$.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\alph*.)]
  \item How much time will it take the train to stop?
  \item What distance will it take the train to stop?
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Ex \#3} 

You drop an object from the top of a building that is 10.6~m tall.  How much time will it take the object to hit the ground?

\paragraph{Ex \#4} 

You throw a ball straight up in the air at a velocity of 17~m/s.  What is the maximum height the ball will reach?
