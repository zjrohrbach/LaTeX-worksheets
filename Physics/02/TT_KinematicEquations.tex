\question
  A car accelerates from 14 m/s to 21 m/s in 6.0 s.  What is the car's acceleration?

  \begin{solution}
    1.17~m/s$^2$

    Extension: How far does the car travel in this time? (105.1 m)
  \end{solution}

\question
  A world-class sprinter can reach a top speed (of about 11.5~m/s) in the first 18.0 meters of the race.  What is her average acceleration?  Assume she started from rest.

  \begin{solution}
    3.36~m/s$^2$

    Extension: How long does it take her to reach that speed? (3.42 s)

  \end{solution}

\question
  A marble rolling down a track starts at rest and accelerates at a rate of \SI{1.2}{\meter\per\second^2}.  How much time does it take the marble to roll {\bf 85~cm}?

  \begin{solution}
    $\sqrt{1.42}=1.19$ s
  \end{solution}

\question
  In coming to a stop, a car leaves skid marks 65 m long on the highway.  Assuming a deceleration of \SI{-4.0}{\meter\per\second^2}, estimate the speed of the car just before braking.

  \begin{solution}
    $\sqrt{520}=22.8$ m/s
  \end{solution}
