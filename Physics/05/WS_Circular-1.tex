\question
  Samuel's father swings him in a circle so that he makes 6 complete rotations in 8 seconds.  Samuel's feet are 1.2 m out from the center of rotation, and his mass is 14 kg.

\question
  You are spinning a ball attached to a rope above your head.  The mass of the ball is 0.1~kg and the radius of the string is 0.6~m. What is the {\bf force of tension} in the rope if the ball has a velocity of 3.1~m/s?
  \vs[2] 

\question
  You are in a car going around a right-hand turn of radius 3.8~m.  The force of friction between your tires and the ground is 79,000~N.  If your car has a mass of 1200~kg, what is the maximum speed you can take through the turn?

\question
  The carousel in the previous problem goes around two times in 90 seconds.  Find the rotational velocity and the tangential velocity of both kids.  (You should have four answers...) \label{math}

  \begin{tabular}{p{2.7in}|p{2.7in}}
    Bobby Tangential & Bobby Rotational \\[10em]\hline
    Janey Tangential & Janey Rotational \\[10em]
  \end{tabular}


\question
  Does your answer for question \ref{math} match what you said in question \ref{concept}?  Explain.
