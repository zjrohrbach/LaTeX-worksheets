  \paragraph{Ex 1)}
  Starting from rest, a child zooms down a frictionless slide from an initial height of 3.00 m.  What is her speed at the bottom of the slide?  Assume she has a mass of 25.0 kg.

  \vfill

  \paragraph{Ex 2)}
  You slide a trashcan ($m = \SI{10.2}{\kilo\gram}$) across the floor with an initial velocity of 7.9 m/s.
  
  \vspace{1em}
  
      (a) If the trashcan eventually stops, what is the work done by friction?
      
      (b) If the force of friction is \SI{-29.4}{\newton}, how far does the trash can go?
