You can complete this problem by test day for 5 bonus points!  Even if you don't get it totally correct, you will get partial bonus for attempting.  {\bf Note that you will need to use physics from both the Momentum unit and the Energy unit to solve!}

A force of 20~N is applied to a 2-kg block for 0.28~s.  It then travels at a constant velocity along a frictionless surface before coming to a frictionless ramp that is 3~m high and at a 20-degree angle.  At the bottom of the ramp, it encounters a friction force of $-2$~N.  How far from the bottom of the ramp (the value $d$ on the diagram) will the block slide until coming to a stop? (\emph{Hint:} Use the diagram below to label the values you might have.  You will need to break the problem into smaller parts.)
