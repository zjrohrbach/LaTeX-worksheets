\question
  A buoy on the ocean stays at a stationary location.  An ocean wave comes toward it.  The distance between one crest and the next crest is 6.0~m.  The buoy moves up and down with a frequency of 0.25~Hz.  The amplitude of the wave is 1.0~m.

\question
  If a child on a swing goes back and forth (one oscillation) 11 times in 30 seconds, find her period and frequency. \vs 

\question
  Why does it make sense that a wave with a higher frequency also must have a shorter wavelength?
  \vs


\question
  A sound wave has a wavelength of 2.13 m and a frequency of 160 Hz, what is the velocity of the wave?
  \vs

\question
  The radio station WZPL broadcasts at a frequency of \SI{99.5}{\mega\hertz} (that's \SI{99.5e6}{\hertz}).  Radio waves travel at a speed of \SI{3.00e8}{\meter\per\second}.  How long is the wavelength of WZPL's radio waves?
  \vs
