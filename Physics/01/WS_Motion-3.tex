    \paragraph{Acceleration}
      A brand new ride has opened at King's Island.  Use the information provided to answer the questions.
  \end{EnvUplevel}

  \question
    The ride starts at rest and then gets up to a speed of 50 m/s in 1.9 s.  What is its acceleration?
    \vs

  \question
    Once it is traveling at \SI{50}{\meter\per\second}, it accelerates at a rate of \SI{-9.2}{\meter\per\second^2} for \SI{3.0}{\second}.  What is its velocity after this time?
    \vs

  \question
    The ride now maintains a constant velocity for 10 s.  What is its acceleration during this time?
    \vs

  \question
    Finally, the ride comes to an abrupt a stop in \SI{0.88}{\second}. What is its acceleration?
    \vs
