\question
  What is the final velocity of a roller coaster 
  that starts at rest and accelerates at a rate of 
  \SI{5}{\meter\per\second^2} for 0.8 s?
  \vs


\question
  How much time would it take an object accelerating 
  at \SI{9}{\meter\per\second^2} to go from 25 m/s to 56 m/s?
  \vs


\question
  After accelerating at a rate of \SI{-5}{\meter\per\second^2}
  for 8 seconds, you are now traveling at 11.3 m/s.  How fast 
  were you going before you started accelerating?
  \vs
