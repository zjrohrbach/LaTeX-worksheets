  \question 
    Sara, an amazingly well-rounded athlete, participates in a grueling race.  She begins the race by running 5000~m from the starting line to checkpoint~A in {\bf 20 minutues and 40 seconds}.  What is her velocity (in m/s)?
    \vs\hrule\vs
  \question
    Next, Sara swims \SI{500}{\meter} from checkpoint~A to checkpoint~B with a velocity of \SI{1.1}{\meter\per\second}.  How much time does it take her?

  \question
    From checkpoint~B she rides a bike with a velocity of 4.9 m/s for {\bf 1~hour}.  What is the distance between checkpoint~B to checkpoint~C?

  \question
    Sara must now run all the way back to the starting line to finish the race.  Completely exhausted, Sara climbs into her single-engine airplane and flies back to the starting line.  What is her velocity to go from checkpoint~C to the starting line if the plane ride is {\bf 19 minutes and 17 seconds}?
    \vs\hrule\vs
  \question
    Calculate Sara's {\bf average speed} for the entire race and her {\bf average velocity}.
