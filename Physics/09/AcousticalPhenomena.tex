  \begin{parts}
    \part natural frequency \vs 
    \part resonance \vs 
  \end{parts}

\question

\question
  Look at the diagram below (Figure 20.21 from the textbook).  Label the regions of constructive and destructive interference.

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \node at (0,0) 
      {\includegraphics[width=12cm]{Fig20_21.jpg}};
    \fill[white] (-3,-1) rectangle (6,.26);
  \end{tikzpicture}

  \question

    \begin{parts}
      \part Label the regions of constructive and destructive interference.
      \part What is the frequency of the tone being produced? \vs
      \part What is the beat frequency? \vs
    \end{parts}

\question
  Draw your own beats!  Draw two bugs jumping on the water.  One bug jumps forward 3 cm each hop; the other bug jumps forward 4 cm each hop.

  \begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw[dotted] (0,0) grid[step=0.5] (15,-1.5);
  \end{tikzpicture}


\question Using all that we've talked about, come up with your own description of the cause of beats. \vs
