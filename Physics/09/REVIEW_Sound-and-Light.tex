\question
  You are driving {\bf north} at 17~m/s when you see a police car in your rearview mirror that is also driving {\bf north}, but at 32~m/s. 

  \begin{parts}
    \part 
      If the police car produces a frequency of 6000 Hz, what frequency do you hear? \vs 

    \part
      You pull over to the side of the road and come to a stop as the police car approaches, what sound do you hear now? \vs 

    \part
      You are still at rest at the side of the road, but the cruiser now passes you.  What sound do you now hear? \vs
