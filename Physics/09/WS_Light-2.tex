\question
  A \emph{diverging} lens has a focal length of 9.0~cm, and an object is placed 3.0~cm from the lens.

  \begin{parts}
    \part What would be the distance of the image from the lens? \vs
    \part What is the magnification of the image? \vs
    \part Will the image be real or virtual?  How do you know? \vspace{7em}
  \end{parts}
