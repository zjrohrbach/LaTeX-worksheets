\question
  A certain galaxy glows with a frequency of \SI{4.991e14}{\hertz} (orange).  When you observe the galaxy from a telescope, the color of light you see has a frequency of \SI{4.989e14}{\hertz} (slightly redder).

  \begin{parts}
    \part
      Assume the earth is approximately stationary.  Is the galaxy moving toward the earth or away from the earth?
      \vs

    \part
      {\emph Bonus!}  How fast is the galaxy moving? (Solve on the back!)
