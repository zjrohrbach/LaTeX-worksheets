\section*{General Project Reminders}

\begin{itemize}
  \item 
    You will be giving a 5-7 minute presentation the week before Spring Break on your topic.
  \item 
    If you've forgotten your topic, check \texttt{\href{https://go.rohrbachscience.com/project-topics}{https://go.rohrbachscience.com/project-topics}}.
  \item	
    Your project should be built around a diagram, graph, model, etc. that substantially contributes to our understanding of the topic.  A presentation aid (like PowerPoint, Prezi, etc.) is not a visual!
  \item
    In addition to your visual, you will likely want to have a presentation aid like a PowerPoint, a poster, or something similar.
  
\end{itemize}

\section*{Your Goal Today}

Your goal for today is to find some good sources about your topic and to start learning about it.  The evidence that you've met the goal will be your Annotated Bibliography that you will submit via Schoology by this Sunday, Jan 28, at 11:59pm.  Your Annotated Bibliography will include the following information for {\bf three sources}:
%
\begin{enumerate}
  \item APA Citation 
  \item A summary about the source.
  \item A sentence that evaluates the source.
  \item A sentence that explains why this source is helpful to your research. 
\end{enumerate}


\section*{Research Pathfinder}

Please see Mrs. Kovach's Research Pathfinder at \texttt{\href{https://go.rohrbachscience.com/pathfinder}{https://go.rohrbachscience.com/pathfinder}}.  There are excellent links to help you get started on your research.  The last page of the Pathfinder includes instructions on how to cite your three sources and complete their annotations.

\section*{Questions to Guide Your Research}

\emph{These are questions to help you if you get stuck.  I do not need you to turn in answers to these questions.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What will my visual be?  A diagram? A model? A graph? A flow chart?
  \item What is the science behind my topic?  Why is it interesting/important?
  \item (\emph{if you have a scientist}): What scientific theories is my person responsible for?
  \item (\emph{if you have a building project}): How will I build it?  What materials will I need?
\end{enumerate}
