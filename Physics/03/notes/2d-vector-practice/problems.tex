\paragraph{Ex \#1} 

You hike 20 meters east and then 40 meters north.  What is your displacement (magnitude and direction)?

\pagebreak

\paragraph{Ex \#2} 

You row east across a river at a speed of 7 m/s.  The river flows north at a speed of 3 m/s.  From the perspective of someone standing on the shore, what is your velocity (magnitude and direction)?

\pagebreak

\paragraph{Ex \#3} 

A ball is thrown with an initial resultant velocity of 12.5 m/s at angle 37$^\circ$ above horizontal.  Calculate the $x$- and $y$- components of the ball's initial velocity.


\pagebreak

\paragraph{Ex \#4} 

An airplane comes in for a landing at a speed of 67 m/s.  Its angle is 15 degrees below horizontal.  Calculate the $x$- and $y$- components of the airplane's velocity
