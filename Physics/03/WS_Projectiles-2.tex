\question
  A catapult launches a stone into the air at an angle of $25^\circ$ and a velocity of 12 m/s

  \begin{parts}
    \part 
      Draw a diagram of the situations and write down knowns and unknowns.
      \vs

    \part
      Consider that the stone is initially moving at an angle.  Find the $x$- and $y$- components of its initial velocity.
      \vs
  
    \part
      What is the stone's maximum height?
      \vs
  
    \part
      How long is the stone in the air?
      \vs
  
    \part
      How far in the $x$-direction did the stone travel?
      \vs

\question
  A baby eagle is in a nest atop a 23 m tall tree.  You are 13 m away from the base of the tree and need to throw some food up to the bird or it will starve!  \emph{Hint: assume that your food will be at its maximum height when it reaches the baby eagle.}
  
  \begin{parts}
    \part
      Draw a diagram of the situations and write down knowns and unknowns.
      \vs
    
    \part
      With what initial $y$- velocity must you throw the food?
      \vs
    
    \part
      How much time would it take the food to reach the nest?
      \vs
    
    \part
      What is the $x$-velocity of the food?
      \vs
    
    \part
      With what initial resultant velocity and at what angle must the food be thrown?
      \vs
