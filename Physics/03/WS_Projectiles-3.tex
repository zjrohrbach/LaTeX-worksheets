\question
  A Hollywood stunt woman drives a car off a cliff that is 94 m high.  With what velocity must she drive the car so that it lands on a barge 250 m away from the bottom of the cliff?

  \begin{parts}
    \part 
      Draw a diagram of the situations and write down knowns and unknowns.
      \vs

    \part
      How much time will it take for the car to fall down the cliff?

    \part
      What velocity did the woman need to have going off the cliff?
      \vs
  
    \part
      What is the woman's $y$-velocity just before she hits the ground?
      \vs
  
    \part
      Draw a triangle to find the woman's {\bf resultant final velocity} and the {\bf angle}.

\question
  Evel Knievel is attempting to jump his motorcycle from the roof of one building to the roof of another building that has the same height.  To do so he rides at 25 m/s and uses a ramp with a $30^\circ$ angle.
