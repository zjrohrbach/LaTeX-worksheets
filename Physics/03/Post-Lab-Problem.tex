\question
  If you want to find out how far a projectile will go, you usually need to do two calculations.  What are those two calculations?
  \vs

\question
  In the lab we did last class, you found that the marble exited the ramp at about 1.2~m/s.  Let's calculate how high we would need to place the ramp if we wanted the marble to hit 0.40~m from the base of the table.
